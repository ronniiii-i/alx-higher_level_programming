Using ``print_square(size)``
------------------------------

Parameter must be an integer
Prints square with the size ``size``

Import function:

    >>> print_square = __import__('4-print_square').print_square

Now use it:

Basic Usage:
    >>> print_square(4)
    ####
    ####
    ####
    ####

    >>> print_square(1)
    #

Size is less than 0:
    >>> try:
    ...     print_square(-1)
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print(e)
    size must be >= 0

Size is a Float:
    >>> try:
    ...     print_square(2.3)
    ... except TypeError as e:
    ...     print(e)
    size must be an integer

Size is anything but integer:
    >>> try:
    ...     print_square("not int")
    ... except TypeError as e:
    ...     print(e)
    size must be an integer

    >>> try:
    ...     print_square(None)
    ... except TypeError as e:
    ...     print(e)
    size must be an integer

Size not defined:
    >>> try:
    ...     print_square()
    ... except TypeError as e:
    ...     print(e)
