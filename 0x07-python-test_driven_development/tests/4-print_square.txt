Using ``print_square(size)``
------------------------------

Parameter must be an integer
Prints square with the size ``size``

Import function:

    >>> print_square = __import__('4-print_square').print_square

Now use it:

Basic Usage
===========

Size is positive integer:
    >>> print_square(2)
    ##
    ##

    >>> print_square(3)
    ###
    ###
    ###


Testing
=============

Size is not integer:
    >>> try:
    ...     print_square("hi")
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print(e)
    size must be an integer

    >>> try:
    ...     print_square((2, 4))
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print(e)
    size must be an integer

    >>> try:
    ...     print_square(None)
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print(e)
    size must be an integer

Size is negative integer:
    >>> try:
    ...     print_square(-4)
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print(e)
    size must be >= 0

Size is positive float:
    >>> try:
    ...     print_square(3.5)
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print(e)
    size must be an integer

Size is negative float:
    >>> try:
    ...     print_square(-3.5)
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print(e)
    size must be an integer

Size is not given:
    >>> try:
    ...     print_square()
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print(e)
    print_square() missing 1 required positional argument: 'size'
