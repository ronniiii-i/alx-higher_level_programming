# Python- hello world

In this project I learnt
- How to use the Python interpreter
- How to print text and variables using print
- How to use strings
- What are indexing and slicing in Python
- What is the official Python coding style and how to check your code with pycodestyle

## Tasks

- **0. Run Python file**
	- [0-run](0-run): Write a Shell script that runs a Python script. The Python file name will be saved in the environment variable $PYFILE

- **1. Run inline**
	- [1-run_inline](1-run_inline): Write a Shell script that runs Python code. The Python code will be saved in the environment variable $PYCODE

- **2. Hello, print**
	- [2-print.py](2-print.py): Write a Python script that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line.

- **3. Print integer**
 	- [3-print_number.py](3-print_number.py): Complete this [source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00.py) in order to print the integer stored in the variable number, followed by Battery street, followed by a new line.

- **4. Print float**
	- [4-print_float.py](4-print_float.py): Complete the [source code ](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00.py/blob/master/4-print_float.py)in order to print the float stored in the variable number with a precision of 2 digits.

- **5. Print string**
	- [5-print_string.py](5-print_string.py): Complete this [source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00.py/blob/master/5-print_string.py) in order to print 3 times a string stored in the variable str, followed by its first 9 characters.

- **6. Play with strings**
	- [6-concat.py](6-concat.py): Complete this [source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00.py/blob/master/6-concat.py) to print Welcome to Holberton School! using the variables str1 = "Holberton" and str2 = "School"

- **7. Copy - Cut - Paste**
	-[7-edges.py](./7-edges.py): Python script that sets three string variables based on the string contained in the variable `word` as follows:
		- `word_first_3`: Contains the first three letters of the variable `word`.
		- `word_last_2`: Contains the last two letters of the variable `word`.
		- `middle_word`: Contains the value of the variable `word` without the first and last letters.
		- Completion of [this source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00.py/blob/master/7-edges.py)
