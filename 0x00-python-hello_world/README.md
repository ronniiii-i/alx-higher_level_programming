In this project I learnt
- How to use the Python interpreter
- How to print text and variables using print
- How to use strings
- What are indexing and slicing in Python
- What is the official Python coding style and how to check your code with pycodestyle

## Tasks

- **0. Run Python file**
	- [0-run](0-run): Write a Shell script that runs a Python script. The Python file name will be saved in the environment variable $PYFILE
- **1. Run inline**
	- [1-run_inline](1-run_inline): Write a Shell script that runs Python code. The Python code will be saved in the environment variable $PYCODE
- **2. Hello, print**
	- [2-print.py](2-print.py): Write a Python script that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line.
- **3. Print integer**
 	- [3-print_number.py](3-print_number.py): Complete this [source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00.py) in order to print the integer stored in the variable number, followed by Battery street, followed by a new line. The output of the script should be:
		1. the number, followed by Battery street
		2. followed by a new line
- **4. Print float**
	- [4-print_float.py](4-print_float.py): Complete the [source code ](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00.py/blob/master/4-print_float.py)in order to print the float stored in the variable number with a precision of 2 digits. The output of the program should be:
		1. Float:, followed by the float with only 2 digits
